                        The jaguar is most commonly found around the Pantanals in Brazil. 
                                They emerge from the leafy undergrowth of the jungle frequently during the dry season to hunt for their prey near the water. 
                                During the dry season the wet landscape of the pantanals dries up causing the only main source of water in the area to be from the river. 
                                Unfortunately, this species is under threat. The following causes of this are:
                                <br>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Deforestation - fragmentation of the rainforest has led to separation of males and females resulting in a decline in jaguar numbers.</li>
                                <li>Human Culling - Local farmers kill the jaguats in retaliation for them killing their livestock</li>
                                <li>Black market trading - The jaguar's rosetted coat is coveted. </li>
                              </ul>  
                             
                        </p>

               <div class="textcontainer">
                <p>The blue Hyacinth Macaw can only be found in three small regions in South America: the Pantanal, Paraguay and Bolivia. 
                    They are the longest parrot in the world and can be up to 1 metre from their head to the tip of their tail. 
                    The Hyacinth macaw is very intelligent and has been known to use tools such as pieces of wood to open hard fruits and nuts. 
                    Unfortunately, this species is vulnerable due to large scale farming. Actions directly affecting the Macaw are:
                    <ul>
                    <li> Grass fires -grass burned by farmers creates smoke destroying their nests in nearby trees.</li>
                    <li>Logging - decimation of trees narrows their habitat range separating individuals and preventing reproduction cycles.</li>
                    <li>Cattle ranching - the cattle graze on young trees that the Hyacinth Macaw relies on for food and nesting thus creating an inhospitable environment for the Macaw.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                
                
                </li>

                     <img class="carousel_images" src="C:\Users\frey_\OneDrive\Documents\CFG Web Dev course\Project\Continent Page\full body sloth.jpg" width="150" alt="front on sloth">
                     <div class="textcontainer">
                        <p>There are two main species of sloths: two toed and three toed. Within these two categories there are 6 sub species, all of which occupy South and Central America.
                            These sluggish tree-dwellers climb through the canopy at 40 yards per day and feed off leaves, twigs and bugs. 
                            Their metabolic rate is the reason for their extremely slow movement - with such a slow metabolic rate, they spend 15-20 hours a day sleeping. 
                            They are excellent swimmers and love to go for a dip by dropping from trees into the cool, refreshing water. 
                            Sloths are under threat due to human activity such as cattle ranching, deforestation and logging; in particular, 
                            the Pygmy sloth is critically endangered with less than 100 individuals estimated to remain in Panama.
